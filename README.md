![ESP32](./esp32-datasheet/esp32_doit_devkit_v1.png)

## Overview

This project implements home automation functionalities using the ESP32 microcontroller and ESP Rainmaker framework. ESP Rainmaker simplifies the development of IoT applications by providing a suite of tools and APIs for device configuration, cloud connectivity, and remote control.

## Features

- **Device Configuration**: Easily configure device parameters such as Wi-Fi credentials and MQTT settings using the ESP Rainmaker mobile app.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Seamlessly connect your ESP32 device to popular cloud platforms for data logging and remote monitoring.
- **Remote Control**: Control home appliances and devices remotely through the ESP Rainmaker app or web interface.
- **Modular Design**: Implement custom functionalities and integrate various sensors and actuators to suit your home automation needs.
- **Scalable**: Expand your home automation system by adding multiple ESP32 devices and integrating them into a unified network.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- Sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion)
- Actuators (e.g., relays for controlling lights, fans)
- Power Supply

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE with ESP32 Board Support
- ESP Rainmaker Library
- ESP Rainmaker Mobile App (for device configuration and control)

## Installation
